## Issues
- Sometimes you can get stuck on the wall.
- Deathtime gets resetted everytime you boot up the game.
- Battle musics sounds terrible, music with *.mid* format aren't supported in GMS.

- There are some common errors of not initialize a variable.
- Music is quite a mess to work.
- *move_wrap* function seems to not be working as it should be.
- UI depth order.
